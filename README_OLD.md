# Kubera - AI-Powered Competitive Analysis Tool

## Overview

Kubera is an intelligent market analysis tool that helps e-commerce merchants make data-driven pricing decisions. It uses Google Vertex AI with web search grounding to analyze real-time market prices, customer feedback, and competitive positioning to generate actionable recommendations for increasing sales.

The system automatically performs a comprehensive 3-step analysis for any product:

- **Price Discovery** - Searches the web for current prices across multiple retailers
- **Customer Analysis** - Analyzes reviews, feedback, and market sentiment  
- **Strategy Generation** - Provides actionable pricing recommendations with reasoning

**Output:** Clear, merchant-friendly recommendations based on industry-standard pricing metrics (not AI opinions).

## Features

✅ **Real-Time Price Comparison** - Searches 5+ retailers for current prices and uses web search grounding for accurate data  
✅ **Customer Sentiment Analysis** - Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and deal-breakers from real customer reviews  
✅ **Rule-Based Recommendations** - Uses deterministic formulas (not AI guesses) for trustable insights  
✅ **Festival Detection** - Automatically adjusts strategy for Indian festivals and sale seasons  
✅ **Image Support** - Can analyze product images for exact variant matching and better price comparison  
✅ **Confidence Scoring** - Shows reliability of each recommendation based on market stability  
✅ **Auto-Retry Mechanism** - Automatically retries failed API calls with proper error handling  
✅ **Progress Indicators** - Real-time CLI status updates during processing  

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **Google Cloud Account** with Vertex AI enabled
- **Google Cloud Service Account** with credentials

### Setup

#### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Kubera

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

#### 2. Google Cloud Setup

Create a Google Cloud project and enable Vertex AI:

```bash
# Create new project (or use existing one)
gcloud projects create kubera-pricing --name="Kubera Pricing"

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable generativelanguage.googleapis.com

# Create service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create kubera-sa \
  --display-name="Kubera AI Service Account"

# Grant Vertex AI User role
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:kubera-sa@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/aiplatform.user"

# Download credentials
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/kubera-credentials.json \
  --iam-account=kubera-sa@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Alternative:** Use Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.examples .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual values:

```env
# Path to your service account credentials (if using service account)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/kubera-credentials.json

# OR use Application Default Credentials path (if using gcloud auth)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json

# Your Google Cloud Project ID
GOOGLE_VERTEX_PROJECT=your-project-id

# Google Cloud region (where Vertex AI models run)
GOOGLE_VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1

# Project ID (can be same as GOOGLE_VERTEX_PROJECT)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

**⚠️ Important:**
- Do NOT add spaces around `=` signs in `.env` file
- Use absolute paths for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- Ensure the credentials file has proper permissions

#### 4. Run the Application

```bash
pnpm start
# or
npm start
```

### Usage

#### Run Complete Analysis

```bash
pnpm start
```

The system will:
1. Search for product prices across multiple retailers
2. Analyze customer feedback and expectations
3. Prompt you to enter your merchant price
4. Generate a comprehensive pricing recommendation report

#### Alternative Usage Methods

You can import and use individual modules programmatically:

```typescript
import { searchProductPrices } from "./web-search";
import { analyzeCustomerFeedback } from "./customer-expectation";
import { analyzeMarketStrategy } from "./market-analysis";

// Price discovery
const priceData = await searchProductPrices({ 
  productName: "iPhone 15 Pro",
  images: ["path/to/image.jpg"] // optional
});

// Customer analysis
const feedback = await analyzeCustomerFeedback({ 
  productName: "iPhone 15 Pro" 
});

// Market strategy
const strategy = await analyzeMarketStrategy(
  priceData, 
  feedback, 
  89999 // your merchant price
);
```

## How It Works

### Pricing Metrics & Formulas

### Pricing Metrics & Formulas

Kubera uses **industry-standard retail pricing formulas** to make decisions:

### 1️⃣ Price Index (Primary Metric)
```
Price Index = (Your Price / Median Market Price) × 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- `< 95` → Aggressive pricing (underpriced)
- `95-105` → Market aligned (optimal)
- `105-108` → Moderately overpriced  
- `> 108` → Significantly overpriced

### 2️⃣ Price Spread (Market Volatility)
```
Price Spread % = ((Max - Min) / Median) × 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- `< 10%` → Stable market, high confidence
- `10-20%` → Moderate variation
- `> 20%` → Volatile market, low confidence

### 3️⃣ Competitive Rank
```
Rank = Your position when all prices sorted (1 = cheapest)
```

### 4️⃣ Position Percentile
```
Position Percentile = (Rank / Total Retailers) × 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- `0-25%` → Bottom quartile (cheapest)
- `25-75%` → Middle range (competitive)
- `75-100%` → Top quartile (premium)

---

## 🎯 Decision-Making Logic

### How Recommendations Are Generated

Kubera uses **deterministic rules** (not AI opinions):

#### For OVERPRICED Products (Price Index > 108):
1. **Primary:** Reduce price by 3-5%
2. **Alternative:** Add value bundle (bank discounts, free delivery)
3. **Urgency:** Create flash sales or limited-time offers

#### For MARKET-ALIGNED Products (Price Index 95-108):
1. **Primary:** Hold price, focus on conversion
2. **Secondary:** Improve product listing quality
3. **Tertiary:** Highlight product strengths

#### For UNDERPRICED Products (Price Index < 95):
1. **Primary:** Increase price by 1-3%
2. **Alternative:** Maintain price, push volume
3. **Always:** Address customer deal-breakers

### LLM Role

The AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) is used **ONLY** for:
- ✅ Gathering real-time data via web search
- ✅ Explaining recommendations in natural language
- ✅ Adding context from customer feedback

The AI does **NOT**:
- ❌ Decide actions (rules decide)
- ❌ Change numbers (formulas decide)
- ❌ Invent recommendations (templates decide)

**This ensures trustable, reproducible results.**

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Authentication Error**
```
Error: GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY environment variable is not set
```
**Fix:** Check your `.env` file has correct `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path

**2. No Web Search Results**
```
⚠️ No results found for the product
```
**Fix:** 
- Check product name spelling
- Try more generic search terms
- Verify internet connection

**3. JSON Parsing Error**
```
Failed to parse JSON response: Unterminated string
```
**Fix:**
- Response was truncated
- Already handled with automatic retry
- Increase `maxTokens` if needed

**4. Rate Limiting**
```
429 Too Many Requests
```
**Fix:**
- Wait a few seconds between requests
- Check your Google Cloud quota limits
